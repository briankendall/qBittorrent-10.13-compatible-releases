## qBittorrent 10.13 compatible releases

I've set up this repo specifically for publicly releasing builds of qBittorrent 4.3.3 and later that are compatible with macOS 10.13. I'm doing this for those of us that are still using older Apple hardware that can't be upgraded past macOS 10.13, or that think that macOS 10.13 better than any of the releases to come after it and don't want to upgrade (such as myself).

I will likely keep making new builds so long as qBittorrent can be built with Qt 5.15. At some point, though, they will likely switch fully over to using Qt 6 which does not support macOS 10.13, and unless they go out of their way to maintain compatibility with Qt 5, that will probably stop me from being able to make 10.13 compatible builds.

I will sign these builds with my Apple developer account just to make it slightly less sketchy that some internet rando is releasing them. If you're concerned about that, then best to build it yourself!

My instructions for building qBittorrent 4.3.3 and later on macOS 10.13 can be found [here](https://github.com/briankendall/qBittorrent-10.13-compatible-releases/blob/master/BUILD.md).
